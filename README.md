# nlp-features
Syntactic and semantic features used for NLP

* *classification* looks at **fake** vs **real** news classification based on syntactic and semantic features 
Naive Bayes, Random Forests, and Deep Neural Network classifiers.

* *IR* is a proxy problem for information retrieval.  Here we look at the quality of determining if a pair 
of questions are semantically equivalent.  We compare the traditional bag-of-words approach to the newer word embeddings approach.
